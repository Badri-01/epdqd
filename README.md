# epdqd
An Efficient Privacy Preserving Data Query And Dissemination Scheme (EPDQD) for Vehicular Cloud.
By using the lightweight homomorphic encryption technique and the Chinese Remainder
Theorem, the road side unit can aggregate and recover multiple data query requests
without knowing the linkability of the data query request and its origin vehicle. EPDQD
also adopts the message authentication code and non-interactive secure session keys to
achieve the authentication of data query requests and the integrity of data transmission.
